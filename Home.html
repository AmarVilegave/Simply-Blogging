									Spider-Man Remastered Offers More Evidence of PSN Account
									Linking on PC
								</h5>
								<p class="card-text para">
									Last week Sony launched a new section of the PlayStation
									website dedicated to PlayStation games on PC, and it seemed to
									hint toward future PSN account integration for PC players.
									More evidence for this has now seemingly been found by data
									miners who have found mentions of PSN account integration
									while trawling the PC files of Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered.

									after launch, Horizon Forbidden West has become the second
									biggest launch title of the PS5, just behind Spider-Man: Miles

									Another Reference to PlayStation PC Launcher Has Been Found
								</h5>
								<p class="card-text para">
									Dataminers have unearthed even more evidence that Sony is
									working on its own PlayStation PC launcher of sorts. This
									development comes a day after Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered
									PC files confirmed yet again that Sony’s toying with PSN
									account integration, allowing users to link their PSN ID to PC
									within first-party games that have been ported over to the
									platform. By introducing a PC launcher, Sony will be joining a
									growing list of companies, like Rockstar Games and Ubisoft, in
									making its own launcher separate from platforms like Steam and
									Epic Games Store.
