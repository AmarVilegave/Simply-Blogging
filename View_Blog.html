							Spider-Man Remastered Offers More Evidence of PSN Account Linking
							on PC
						</h5>
						<p class="card-text">
							Last week Sony launched a new section of the PlayStation website
							dedicated to PlayStation games on PC, and it seemed to hint toward
							future PSN account integration for PC players. More evidence for
							this has now seemingly been found by data miners who have found
							mentions of PSN account integration while trawling the PC files of
							Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
							Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on PC includes references to
							PlayStation Network account integration within its files and these
							seem to suggest Sony is still thinking about integrating their
							first-party PC games with PSN in the future. As spotted by several
							dataminers (thanks VGC), the game’s files contain numerous
							mentions of “PSNAccountLinked” and “PSNLinkingEntitlements”,
							suggesting Sony may even be considering offering in-game bonuses
							for those that have linked Spider-Man to a PlayStation Network
							account. One of those bonuses was “LevelCapExtras”, which sounds
							like extra bonuses when players reach level 50.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
							In other news, the Fortnite x Dragon Ball crossover trailer has
							leaked and confirms Fusion Dance. Elsewhere, Disney and Marvel
							have announced a games showcase for next month and confirmed games
							include Marvel’s Midnight Suns and Disney Dreamlight Valley.

							Hogwarts Legacy Gamescom Appearance Will Offer an ‘Exclusive New
							Look’
						</h5>
						<p class="card-text">
							Host and journalist Geoff Keighley has announced that the upcoming
							Hogwarts Legacy Gamescom appearance in Opening Night Live will
							provide an “exclusive new look” at the game. This is a bit of a
							surprise given that Avalanche Software revealed last week that the
							game would be delayed from its December release window to February
							10, 2023. One might think that the developer would remain silent,
							but it’s likely that its Gamescom appearance was already
							scheduled. That said, what might be shown about the game that we
							haven’t seen yet?
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
							As noted in a tweet posted above from Keighley’s account, Hogwarts
							Legacy will appear in the Gamescom 2022 Opening Night Live
							presentation on Tuesday, August 23 at 11am PT / 2pm ET / 8pm CEST.
							As to what “World Premiere” content might be shown, it will likely
							be a full trailer featuring some gameplay or a part of Hogwarts
							Legacy’s world that we hopefully haven’t seen yet beyond Hogsmeade
							or the Forbidden Forest.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
							Given that we actually know quite a lot about Hogwarts Legacy,
							especially after the State of Play presentation in mid-March
							dedicated to the game, it’s somewhat tough to think about what
							info is missing at this point. Perhaps we will see if Quidditch is
							in the game and how it would work, particularly as there are no
							plans for the title to have multiplayer support. We might see what
							differences there might be throughout the story depending on your
							choice of House or what the school week will look like with you
							attending classes, doing assignments, and completing tests.
