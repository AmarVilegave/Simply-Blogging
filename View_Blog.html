							Spider-Man Remastered Offers More Evidence of PSN Account Linking
							on PC
						</h5>
						<p class="card-text">
							Last week Sony launched a new section of the PlayStation website
							dedicated to PlayStation games on PC, and it seemed to hint toward
							future PSN account integration for PC players. More evidence for
							this has now seemingly been found by data miners who have found
							mentions of PSN account integration while trawling the PC files of
							Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
							Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on PC includes references to
							PlayStation Network account integration within its files and these
							seem to suggest Sony is still thinking about integrating their
							first-party PC games with PSN in the future. As spotted by several
							dataminers (thanks VGC), the game’s files contain numerous
							mentions of “PSNAccountLinked” and “PSNLinkingEntitlements”,
							suggesting Sony may even be considering offering in-game bonuses
							for those that have linked Spider-Man to a PlayStation Network
							account. One of those bonuses was “LevelCapExtras”, which sounds
							like extra bonuses when players reach level 50.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
							In other news, the Fortnite x Dragon Ball crossover trailer has
							leaked and confirms Fusion Dance. Elsewhere, Disney and Marvel
							have announced a games showcase for next month and confirmed games
							include Marvel’s Midnight Suns and Disney Dreamlight Valley.
