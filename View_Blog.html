							Spider-Man Remastered Offers More Evidence of PSN Account Linking
							on PC
						</h5>
						<p class="card-text">
							Last week Sony launched a new section of the PlayStation website
							dedicated to PlayStation games on PC, and it seemed to hint toward
							future PSN account integration for PC players. More evidence for
							this has now seemingly been found by data miners who have found
							mentions of PSN account integration while trawling the PC files of
							Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
							Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on PC includes references to
							PlayStation Network account integration within its files and these
							seem to suggest Sony is still thinking about integrating their
							first-party PC games with PSN in the future. As spotted by several
							dataminers (thanks VGC), the game’s files contain numerous
							mentions of “PSNAccountLinked” and “PSNLinkingEntitlements”,
							suggesting Sony may even be considering offering in-game bonuses
							for those that have linked Spider-Man to a PlayStation Network
							account. One of those bonuses was “LevelCapExtras”, which sounds
							like extra bonuses when players reach level 50.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
							In other news, the Fortnite x Dragon Ball crossover trailer has
							leaked and confirms Fusion Dance. Elsewhere, Disney and Marvel
							have announced a games showcase for next month and confirmed games
							include Marvel’s Midnight Suns and Disney Dreamlight Valley.

							Hogwarts Legacy Gamescom Appearance Will Offer an ‘Exclusive New
							Look’
						</h5>
						<p class="card-text">
							Host and journalist Geoff Keighley has announced that the upcoming
							Hogwarts Legacy Gamescom appearance in Opening Night Live will
							provide an “exclusive new look” at the game. This is a bit of a
							surprise given that Avalanche Software revealed last week that the
							game would be delayed from its December release window to February
							10, 2023. One might think that the developer would remain silent,
							but it’s likely that its Gamescom appearance was already
							scheduled. That said, what might be shown about the game that we
							haven’t seen yet?
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
							As noted in a tweet posted above from Keighley’s account, Hogwarts
							Legacy will appear in the Gamescom 2022 Opening Night Live
							presentation on Tuesday, August 23 at 11am PT / 2pm ET / 8pm CEST.
							As to what “World Premiere” content might be shown, it will likely
							be a full trailer featuring some gameplay or a part of Hogwarts
							Legacy’s world that we hopefully haven’t seen yet beyond Hogsmeade
							or the Forbidden Forest.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
							Given that we actually know quite a lot about Hogwarts Legacy,
							especially after the State of Play presentation in mid-March
							dedicated to the game, it’s somewhat tough to think about what
							info is missing at this point. Perhaps we will see if Quidditch is
							in the game and how it would work, particularly as there are no
							plans for the title to have multiplayer support. We might see what
							differences there might be throughout the story depending on your
							choice of House or what the school week will look like with you
							attending classes, doing assignments, and completing tests.

							Overwatch 2 Cross-Progression Announced, Here’s How You Can Merge
							Existing Accounts
						</h5>
						<p class="card-text">
							Blizzard Entertainment has confirmed Overwatch 2 cross-progression
							support, allowing heroes to carry over their progress as well as
							cosmetics to the upcoming game. Players can start merging their
							existing Overwatch 1 accounts now so that they’re good to go once
							Overwatch 2 releases. Bear in mind that since Overwatch 2 is
							free-to-play, the current game will cease to exist.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
							Do note that all players will need a Battle.net account to play
							regardless of their platform. Starting now, when players log into
							Overwatch, everyone with a linked console account will be prompted
							to select the accounts that they want to merge. All you need to do
							is approve your choice so that your accounts are merged upon
							Overwatch 2’s release.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
							For step-by-step instructions, see the official guidance from
							Blizzard below: Login to Overwatch from your console account.
							Follow the on-screen prompts to scan a QR Code on your mobile
							phone. Enter the code displayed on your console to connect to or
							create your Blizzard Battle.net Account. Once complete, you will
							be prompted to confirm your account upon the next game login to
							merge your accounts. Once you merge a console account with a
							battle.net account, you will be unable to link to a different
							console account on the same platform. Double-check to make sure
							you are linking the correct account to your battle.net account.

							Horizon Forbidden West Has Second Largest PS5 Launch Sales in UK
						</h5>
						<p class="card-text">
							Horizon Forbidden West launch sales have skyrocketed the game to
							the second best-selling game of the PS5. Less than a week after
							launch, Horizon Forbidden West has become the second biggest
							launch title of the PS5, just behind Spider-Man: Miles Morales and
							overtaking last year’s FIFA 22. Horizon Forbidden West also beat
							out last week’s top sellers in the UK, Pokemon: Arceus and Dying
							Light 2.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
							According to Gamesindustry.biz, 68% of Horizon Forbidden West’s
							total physical launch sales were for the PS5 version of the game.
							The rest, making up nearly a third of all physical sales, was for
							the PS4. These numbers will likely change after digital download
							sales numbers release later in the week.The game’s release came
							alongside a resupply in PS5 console stocks, which also resulted in
							an increase in sales for other PS5 titles such as Spider-Man:
							Miles Morales and Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart. Specifically,
							Spider-Man: Miles Morales saw a significant 90% increase in sales
							compared to the previous week.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
							While Forbidden West’s launch has been quite impressive, its
							physical launch sales were nowhere near the series’ previous
							title. Horizon Forbidden West saw a 35% decline in physical sales
							compared to Horizon Zero Dawn. It’s important to note, however,
							that these numbers do not take into account digital downloads. The
							continued scarcity of PS5 consoles is also likely a contributing
							factor.

							Call of Duty Warzone 2 Release Date Rumored to Be in November
						</h5>
						<p class="card-text">
							When Call of Duty Warzone 2 was first revealed, we were told its
							release date would not be until after the release of Call of Duty:
							Modern Warfare 2, and rumor expected this to be 2023. While this
							is certainly true, if the latest rumors are anything to go by then
							we won’t have to wait too much longer: Warzone 2 is expected to be
							released in November 2022.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
							Call of Duty: Warzone 2 is rumored to be released on November 16
							according to an Activision internal document seen by Charlie
							Intel. If this release date rumor is true, this means there will
							be just three weeks between the release of Warzone 2 and Call of
							Duty: Modern Warfare 2 on October 27. It would certainly put paid
							to previous rumors that the game would not be released until 2023.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
							Warzone 2 is expected to be “a massive evolution of Battle Royale
							with all-new playspace and a new sandbox mode”. It is being
							designed by Infinity Ward in tandem with Modern Warfare 2 and will
							be built on new technology. While the game will be released for
							PS5 and PS4, it will not have any ties to its predecessor; player
							progress and cosmetics from Call of Duty: Warzone will not be
							carried over into Warzone 2. Other than more rumored details about
							the map and the addition of NPCs, few other details are known
							about the game. Information on the next Warzone is promised for
							the Call of Duty: Next show on September 15 that will also show
							off the multiplayer segment of Modern Warfare 2 and the new mobile
							version of Call of Duty: Warzone.

							Another Reference to PlayStation PC Launcher Has Been Found
						</h5>
						<p class="card-text">
							Dataminers have unearthed even more evidence that Sony is working
							on its own PlayStation PC launcher of sorts. This development
							comes a day after Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered PC files
							confirmed yet again that Sony’s toying with PSN account
							integration, allowing users to link their PSN ID to PC within
							first-party games that have been ported over to the platform. By
							introducing a PC launcher, Sony will be joining a growing list of
							companies, like Rockstar Games and Ubisoft, in making its own
							launcher separate from platforms like Steam and Epic Games Store.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
							As reported and verified by Video Games Chronicle, dataminers
							found references specifically to a “PlayStation PC launcher” in
							Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered’s PC files. The game’s files were
							also how players discovered that Insomniac Games was considering
							adding PvP and co-op elements to the game at some point. This
							isn’t the first time we’ve seen a reference to a PlayStation PC
							launcher. Back in May, we reported on a new job advertisement
							published by Sony Interactive Entertainment, seeking a director of
							project management specifically for “PC game experiences,” and one
							of the position holder’s task was listed as leading PSN platform
							integration.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
							“Lead and evolve the PlayStation game experience roadmap for all
							game related experiences including SDK development, client
							application experiences as PlayStation network Platform
							integration,” read the now-expired job description. “This role
							will be asked to take the lead on the overall PC gaming
							experiences for PlayStation including the leadership and
							responsibility to implement and deliver to our players worldwide.”
